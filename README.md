# RL_GameBot

In today's world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool for solving complex problems in many domains. One such domain is game AI, where AI agents can be trained to play games and compete with human players. In this project, the idea is to build an AI bot for a 2D city-building game that involves resource collection, optimization, and survival for the Lux AI challenge, utilizing reinforcement learning. Video games are generally used as a platform to test any Reinforcement learning algorithm as it mimics the complexity of a real-world environment. Specifically, this project will be using Proximal Policy Optimization, which is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that tries to identify the optimal action to take during gameplay and enhance its performance.
